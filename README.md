ShulkerBall is my first pmmp plugin using my knowledge about pmmp,pmmp forums and CortexPE's plugin(TeaSpoon).

##Features:1.Adds /summon command to spawn a ShulkerBall(Shulker) or any othet existing mobs.
2.Makes Shulker mob a ball by just hitting it.

Api is for now the latest and if not,just update it.
